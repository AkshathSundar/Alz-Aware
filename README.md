Look through the app.py comments for basic functionality structure overview! To run this on your own computer, clone this repo and go to VS Code or any terminal. (If needed, create virtual environment using python -m venv venv and then typing venv\Scripts\activate). Then, run python app.py. Then click on your local host link and enjoy!! :) So it would look like:

  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  python app.py.
